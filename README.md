Implementing a Simple Calculator

Objective: To practise programming fundamentals such as using algorithms, data structures, and software engineering concepts such as code modularity, documentation, and testing.

Instructions:



Write a simple calculator program in Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Use appropriate data structures such as lists, dictionaries, or stacks to store input and output values.

Implement modular functions for each arithmetic operation to make the code more organised and easier to read.

Write clear and concise documentation for each function explaining the input parameters, output, and purpose of the function.

Test your code using various inputs to ensure it is functioning as expected.

If you're up for a challenge, add more advanced functionalities such as square root, exponentiation, or trigonometric functions.

This activity will help you apply the concepts you learned in the introduction to software engineering course and programming fundamentals course in a practical and engaging way. It will also help you develop problem-solving skills and encourage you to write clean, organized, and efficient code.
